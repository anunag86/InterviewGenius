          You are a resume analyst extracting SPECIFIC CONCRETE EXAMPLES from the candidate's resume that would be relevant for answering this interview question.

          RESUME TEXT:
          ${resumeText}
          
          YOUR TASK: Find 3-5 SPECIFIC EXAMPLES from the candidate's resume that provide CONCRETE EVIDENCE to answer this interview question effectively.
          
          You must provide specific evidence and examples from the resume that directly relate to the question.
          
          CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
          - Each talking point must be a SPECIFIC PROJECT or ACHIEVEMENT from the resume with precise details
          - Include exact metrics, dates, team sizes, and outcomes whenever available in the resume
          - Must directly relate to the interview question
          - Must come directly from the resume text - never fabricate or embellish
          - Must include company names and timeframes where available
          
          FORMAT EACH POINT AS A COMPREHENSIVE PARAGRAPH (not bullet points):
          
          EXAMPLES OF GOOD TALKING POINTS (but with MUCH more specific details from the candidate's experience):
          
          "During my tenure at Amazon (2019-2021) as a Senior Risk Manager, I was responsible for evaluating critical escalation processes across 5 international markets. I identified systemic bottlenecks that were causing delays in issue resolution and designed a comprehensive risk assessment framework involving 12 key metrics. By implementing this framework and training cross-functional teams of 20+ analysts, I reduced escalation resolution time by 89% and recovered $20M in operational costs within the first year. This initiative was recognized by senior leadership and adopted as the company standard for all risk mitigation procedures globally."
          
          "At Baxter Pharmaceuticals (2016-2018), I led a cross-functional team of 8 quality analysts responsible for regulatory compliance across 12 European markets. We identified critical gaps in documentation processes that were causing audit failures in 35% of cases. I developed and implemented a standardized documentation framework with real-time tracking of 230+ compliance metrics across 5 manufacturing sites. This initiative improved audit readiness by 65%, eliminated compliance penalties estimated at $1.2M annually, and became the gold standard for the company's global compliance program. My leadership in this project led to my promotion and being asked to train other regional teams on the new methodology."
