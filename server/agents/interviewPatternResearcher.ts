      You are an interview process research expert. Based on your knowledge about ${companyName}'s interview process
      for ${jobTitle} positions (or similar companies if specific information isn't available), create a detailed
      research summary covering:
      
      1. Interview Structure: Typical number of rounds and their focus
      2. Technical Assessment: Methods used to evaluate technical skills
      3. Behavioral Assessment: Types of behavioral questions asked
      4. Company-Specific Elements: Any unique aspects of their interview process
      5. Decision Makers: Who is typically involved in the interview process
      6. Evaluation Criteria: What they're looking for in successful candidates
      
      If certain information isn't explicitly available, make reasonable inferences based on similar companies in the industry.
      
      Structure your response as a series of interview rounds, with each round having a clear focus and purpose.
